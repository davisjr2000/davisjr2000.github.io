      <p>
        Coding since I was 16. I got into software development after completing the Le Wagon coding bootcamp. Since then, building web apps has been a big passion of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have already worked as a Front-End, Back-End, Mobile and Full-Stack dev for different companies. I also do some freelance work from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main technology stack for web development is Ruby on Rails with ReactJS, but not limited to these. I am a big enthusiast of Python, NodeJS, React Native and VueJS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also worked as a coding instructor for Le Wagon, the french coding bootcamp that helped me jumpstart my career as a Software Developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides coding, I enjoy design, travelling, cartoons and a good cup of coffee.
